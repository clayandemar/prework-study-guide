# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- This project was created to better prepare myself for my coding bootcamp experience.
- This project is a study guide for me to memorize new terms and other coding subjects.
- The problem that this webpage is solving is keeping all of my notes and information in one place.
- I learned the basics and started building the foundation of HTML, CSS, GitHub, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This study guide is seperated into four sections. Each one is specific to the four topics we learned about in our prework. If you open the console, you can see that it is running JavaScript. CSS is shown by the design of the webpage, and HTML was used to structure the content.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
